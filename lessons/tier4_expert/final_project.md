# Tier 4 Final Project: Solvra AI Micro-Agent

## Objective
Build a SolvraScript + SolvraCore hybrid that reacts to learner prompts, schedules async tasks, and calls a compiled `.svc` capability module.

## Suggested Milestones
1. Prototype a SolvraScript orchestrator that asks `What do you want to learn today?` and routes to tier lessons.
2. Compile a helper module (e.g., math coach) with `solvra_compile` and exercise it via `core_module_execute`.
3. Track memory and task metrics with `core_memory_stats()` and custom logs.
4. Persist a progress summary to `logs/` so the CLI scripts can report streaks.

## Deliverables
- A runnable `.svs` orchestrator under `lessons/tier4_expert/` or `final_project/`.
- At least one compiled `.svc` module stored in `build/compiled/`.
- Progress log generated by `./scripts/progress_tracker.sh`.

## Reflection Prompts
- How does the deterministic allocator respond as you chain async tasks?
- Where should you release handles to avoid leaking SolvraCore memory?
- How can dopamine-burst feedback keep ADHD learners motivated between tasks?
